\lettrine[lines=5]{\zallmancaps T}{he} Roman Breviary, recently completed by us, through the exhortation of the most blessed memory of Pope Clement VII, Supreme Pontiff, has been restored \&, rather, called back to the ancient form of reading the sacred scriptures, following the manner of the holy fathers \& ancient councils. I have come to know that many learned \& esteemed men have so approved \& received it, deeming nothing therein to be altered.
Indeed, others, being grave \& prudent individuals, have also noticed \& approved its design, yet they affirm that some things are to be desired in it.
However, we have never doubted that, amidst such a multitude, there may be some who, being accustomed to a different form of prayer, might not find our endeavor as agreeable, for they consider that there is no reason for the clergy to depart from that inveterate custom of prayer.
Moreover, we did not wish the first edition of the Breviary to be considered as the promulgation of a law, but rather as a kind of public deliberation: so that, having presented our opinions, we might seek the judgments of many, \& follow what seemed most suitable \& agreeable to the religion \& piety of most wise \& serious men.
For, indeed, nothing elaborated by human ingenuity was ever so perfect from the outset that it could not be made more perfect by the judgment of many others, as we see even in the ecclesiastical institutions, especially concerning the early Church.
Thus, after considering the opinions
%pp8
of many, which have come to our knowledge partly through spoken words \& partly through writings, we have followed the judgment of those who seemed to us to be the wisest of all, \& gladly added some things, changed others, \& diligently examined everything, while retaining the overall form of the Breviary.
However, since it is the way of things that nothing is so right, nothing so wisely introduced into the life \& use of humans, that its novelty is not displeasing to some, we do not appear to act rashly if, after first summarily presenting the rationale of our entire institution, we now explain it a little more extensively by carefully examining the Breviary.
For me (as I have often professed), when I ponder \& reflect on the beginnings of the ancient institution, by which it was decreed that the initiated clerics, or those presiding over priestly duties, should recite the hourly prayers, which we also call the Canonical Hours, three main reasons seem to have been taken into account.
Firstly, since other people in every city either pursue their individual affairs or are occupied in governing the Republic, the clerics, being called by the vocation of the Lord \& supported by ecclesiastical goods, are primarily entrusted with this duty, both by divine \& human laws, that they might strive, above all, to have God propitious to the people entrusted to them, deserving well of all.
This is achieved not only through sacrifices but also through prayers that proceed from a pious heart. For they (as witnessed \& expressed in the verses of the blessed Pope \& martyr Alexander) intercede on behalf of the people \&, through their prayers \& offerings, erase \& consume the sins of the people. The more worthy they are, the more easily they are heard when they cry out for the needs of others.
This is confirmed by the testimony of the Apostle James, who, exhorting us to pray, says, ``Pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much."
The other reason is that those who, by their example, owe it to the rest of the people to be virtuous \& holy, may become less susceptible to the temptations of the devil if he finds them engaged, as Jerome says, in constant prayer \& frequently diverted from thoughts of worldly matters, becoming accustomed to the contemplation of divine things.
The third reason is that the future teachers of religion should be instructed daily through the reading of sacred scripture \& ecclesiastical histories, ``Embracing that faithful word"
%pp9
\fancyhead[C]{\color{red} Preface}
as Paul says, ``which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, \& to convince the gainsayers."
Indeed, if someone were to carefully consider the mode of prayer handed down from our ancestors, they would clearly understand that the chief purpose of all these practices was held by them. However, somehow, due to the negligence of those who pray, a departure from the most holy traditions of the ancient fathers gradually occurred.
For the sacred books of scripture, which were to be read at specific times of the year according to the customs of our ancestors (as recorded in the writings of Pope Gelasius \& the Roman council of seventy bishops), are now almost entirely omitted in other Breviaries.
Moreover, certain accounts of the lives of saints are so uncultivated \& lacking in selection in the same Breviaries that they seem to have neither authority nor gravity.
Added to this is such a perplexing \& difficult arrangement of prayers that sometimes less effort is required to find them than to read them when found.
Observing these matters, Pope Clement VII of blessed memory, understanding that it was his duty to look after the well-being of other Christians \& especially of the clerics, whom he used as ministers in the administration of the entrusted flock, exhorted me \& entrusted me with the task of arranging the hourly prayers in such a way that they might be restored to that ancient form as far as possible, so that difficulties \& expenses could be eliminated, \& yet there would be no departure from the highest reason instituted long ago by the ancient \& holy fathers, nor would the clerics be deterred from their duty of prayer due to the magnitude of the labor.
I gladly undertook this task, both to obey the most honorable command of Christ's vicar \& to serve the public good to the best of my ability.
With the assistance of some wise members of my household, who were well-versed in sacred literature \& the doctrine of pontifical law, \& who were proficient in both Greek \& Latin, I devoted myself as much as possible to the accomplishment of this task in a convenient \& beneficial manner for the public.
And, above all, it seemed appropriate to us to reintroduce the custom that the entire scripture, most of all the Psalms, should be read throughout the entire year, \& that all the Psalms should be read every week.
Indeed, we observed that both of these practices were highly pleasing to the ancient fathers, who arranged in the Breviary the reading of many books from both the Old \& New Testaments at different times of the year, \& they distributed the Psalms in such a way that the entire Psalter was read each week,
%pp10
which was the custom in the early Church, as reported by a Witness.
However, as we mentioned before, due to the negligence of those who pray, only a small portion of sacred scripture was being read, \& many Psalms were omitted, with only a few repeated on almost a daily basis.
This happened because they sought to avoid the length \& effort of the regular office that had been instituted by their ancestors.
To avoid this, they devised various shortcuts \& introduced the custom of omitting the ordinary ferias \& celebrating the feasts of the saints throughout almost the entire year, including during Lent.
This deviation from the ancient practice is evident in the Council of Laodicea, where it was decreed not to celebrate the feasts of the martyrs during Lent, \& in the Tenth Council of Toledo, which declared that no solemnities of the saints should be celebrated during Lent \& that this regulation had been in place since ancient times.
Recognizing this \& considering the conditions of the times \& the weaknesses of the clerics, we believed that a plan should be devised so that with almost the same effort as when a feast was celebrated, but with less when that of a feria, that the Old Testament was observed, a significant \& beneficial portion of the entire New Testament, excluding only a part of the Apocalypse, \& all the Psalms should be read throughout the year.
We distributed the Psalms in such a way that three Psalms would be read at each hour, with the length of one balanced by the brevity of another. This arrangement would make the daily labor of reading almost the same on all days, whether it is a feria or a feast day.
We also took into account the arrangement of ferias \& feasts as much as possible. We did not change the most convenient order just because a few words in a Psalm could be adapted to some particular feast.
Thus, the most advantageous order was maintained, \& no Psalm was omitted in the weekly rotation, allowing those who understand to contemplate not only those particular verses but also all the mysteries contained in them on every seventh day.
For if we had retained the ancient, correct, \& holy distribution of the Psalms for the ferias, in which certain Psalms are repeated daily, the length of the office would still discourage the clerics, as we have experienced. However, with this most convenient arrangement, aligned with the ancient practice, many are now attracted to fulfill their duty diligently.
While it is permitted to read the Scriptures in the customary way, we have made efforts in this Breviary to reduce the labor considerably through a far
%pp11
simpler \& more expedient arrangement. We have removed the burden \& difficulty of searching for psalms \& other things here \& there, as well as the arduous task of memorizing them over a long period.
Therefore, we have decided to omit verses, responsories, \& chapters. Not because they seemed unnecessary or useless (for they enhance piety \& are sacred portions of Scripture), but because they are mainly intended for chanting, \& readers often encounter trouble when seeking them out. We wanted to make room for a continuous reading of sacred Scripture, which contributes more to the piety \& instruction of private readers, on whom we wanted to place greater emphasis than on those who recite in unison.
Indeed, not everything useful \& beneficial should be piled up in prayer, lest the clergy be burdened with an undue weight. We wish we were so strong as not to find it burdensome to read through the entire Old Testament in a year, for we would gladly propose the reading of all its books.
However, as stated before, we had to consider the weakness of many clerics, lest the labor of prayer exceed proper limits in their case.
The Office of the Blessed Virgin, used in other Breviaries, is omitted here, but this does not diminish its honor. Except for a few feasts, She is adored daily \& implored through various commemorations, \& on many occasions, She is celebrated with an entire office dedicated to Her, on Saturdays almost every week except during Lent, when even the feast of the Annunciation was not celebrated by the ancient fathers, as stated in the Council of Toledo, as mentioned earlier.
And indeed, by omitting the heavy repetition of certain Psalms, it is now not deemed burdensome for the Virgin Mother, to whom it is fittingly pleasing that the clergy are attracted to the divine worship of her Son Jesus Christ through the most convenient \& expeditious means.
Having carefully examined the histories of the saints, we have selected some, drawn mainly from reputable Greek \& Latin authors, \& arranged them throughout the entire year in a more refined but not artificial style, rather conscientiously \& by order of Pope Clement.
For, though it has been decided, as we have shown, that no feasts of the saints are to be celebrated during Lent according to ancient tradition, they are now so diligently observed by the younger generation that we believe it would not be possible to entirely avoid at least some solemn feasts without causing some offense
%pp12
among the weak.
Therefore, while we have retained or sought out anew certain histories of the saints, we have also omitted some that lack both credibility \& gravity. These were rashly introduced privately by certain individuals who, in their desire to avoid the length of the ferial office, eagerly sought out saints' feasts \& had them inserted into the Breviary without consulting the public authority of the Pontiffs. Undoubtedly, some of these feasts belong to the category of those that the Church has rejected through its most sacred \& authoritative decree, as explained in the renowned section that sets forth which scriptures are to be read by clerics in the Roman Church \& which are to be rejected.
There, in the same context where many things are solemnly sanctioned by the highest authority, the most holy \& venerable practice of the holy fathers concerning the histories of the saints, whose authors are unknown, is set forth. Pope Gelasius, in particular, quotes the Acts of the Martyrs, which shine forth with multiple torments \& marvelous triumphs of confession, \& he asks: ``Why should any Catholic doubt that they suffered even greater things in the contest? Enduring everything not by their own strength but by God's grace \& assistance." However, these histories are not read in the holy Roman Church according to ancient tradition \& custom, because the names of those who wrote them are entirely unknown, \& it is believed that they were written either by non-believers or contain superfluous \& less suitable material than the proper order requires.
Thus, Pope Gelasius provides examples of certain saints whose histories were found to be written by heretics \& he declares: ``For this reason, as stated, lest even a slight opportunity for mockery arise, they are not read in the holy Roman Church." Against these deviations from what was wisely established by the holy fathers, we have carefully taken action to avoid entirely those things that are rejected by the public decree of the Church. Furthermore, we have prudently excised certain other elements that were less relevant \& have followed only the most approved materials, in accordance with the command of Paul, whom we are also commanded to follow as an authority in these matters by the same Church.
For in the same passage, when Pope Gelasius speaks about certain histories whose certainty is not entirely established, which were to be read by Catholics,
%pp13
he adds the following:
``But when this comes into the hands of Catholics, let the saying of the blessed Apostle Paul precede: `Test all things, hold fast what is good.' A diligent concern has been taken for prayers on behalf of the Pontiffs, kings, \& for the spiritual \& temporal goods of the faithful. Each day, during Matins \& Vespers, in our times, we pray for peace, justice, \& holiness in the Church, \& commend all the faithful, both the living \& the deceased, to God. This is done even more fervently when the Office of the Dead, or the penitential psalms with the litany \& prayers, are read, as is often done during Lent, which used to be done only on ferias."
However, it was so uncommon in the custom of the clergy to celebrate feasts instead of ferias that most of them would hardly read the ferial office once or twice throughout the entire year. Therefore, if someone observes carefully \& considers the ancient counsel \& institution of the fathers, they will clearly understand that this Breviary is not so much a new invention as it is a restoration of the old Breviary with certain adaptations.
This way of praying, therefore, has three great advantages. Firstly, it provides a knowledge of both Testaments to those who pray. Secondly, it is highly expedient due to its great simplicity \& some brevity. Thirdly, the histories of the saints are written in such a way that they have nothing to offend the serious \& learned minds.
If anyone finds this Breviary laborious, let them compensate for the effort of reading much from the book by pronouncing many things from memory that are frequently repeated elsewhere. Let them combine this labor with the knowledge of sacred Scripture, which grows day by day, \& with the focus of the mind, which God requires above all in those who pray (for this focus must necessarily be greater in readers than in those who merely recite from memory). Such labor will not only be fruitful but also beneficial.
For, as Paul says, we must pray with both spirit \& understanding. For the mind of the one who prays only with the tongue, that is, without attention \& as if doing something else while praying, is without fruit. This often happens to those who rush through the psalms from memory. You have, most holy Father, the rationale of our institution, \& you have the formula of the Breviary. It remains that, just as you have begun, you support our endeavors for the sake of public benefit.
\indent Farewell.

\lettrine[lines=7]{\zallmancaps I}{n} the table inscribed below, you will find the movable feasts for each year in the following way: First, seek the Golden Number of the year for which you are searching the feasts, then under its line, also look for the Dominical Letter of the same year, the one which appears first:
And it is carefully noted under the line:
for the Dominical Letter that is aligned with the Golden Number does not serve that number, but only those above.
Afterward, in the same horizontal line where you found the Dominical Letter, you will also find in which month \& on which day each movable feast falls, \& how many Sundays before Septuagesima there are, all these under their respective headings.
However, in a leap year, to find out how many Sundays before Septuagesima occur, \& likewise on what day Septuagesima itself falls, \& on what day Ash Wednesday falls, you will find by the former letter of that year, which serves up to the feast of St. Matthias.
The rest are sought by the latter letter.
But these two letters of a leap year must be taken in such a way that neither of them is aligned with the Golden Number; for if that happens, ignoring them, one must recur to the next similar letters occurring below.
Moreover, if in a leap year Ash Wednesday is found to have fallen in March by the aforementioned method, it must be moved back by one day.
However, in the next thirty years, it will not be necessary to consult this table, but only the index placed after it, which covers from 1564 to 1593.

\begin{center} \color{red}
How the Hours are to be said, \& in what consists\\the diversity of the Office.
\end{center}

\lettrine[lines=7]{\zallmancaps B}{efore} all else, it must be known that all the hours are said throughout the entire year as explained on the First Sunday of Advent.
Also, for each of the hours, only one hymn is to be said before the Psalms, \& therefore at Lauds, no hymn is said, because Matins \& Lauds are considered as one hour.
Moreover, it must be known that the Psalms are said at all hours on each day of the entire year without any exception, as they are distributed in the Psalter.
Likewise, the first \& second lessons are always said as they are arranged for Sundays, except on the day of the Lord's Nativity \& on the day of Epiphany, because on those days, other lessons are assigned.
It must also be noted that the hymns assigned on the First Sunday of Advent for Prime, Terce, Sext, None, \& Compline, as well as the prayers \color{red} Lord God almighty. \color{black} at Prime \& \color{red} Visit we beseech. \color{black} at Compline, \& the antiphon \color{red} Protect us. \color{black} at Compline, are never omitted throughout the entire year, except during the Triduum before Easter.
Similarly, the antiphons assigned in the Psalter for Prime, Terce, Sext, \& None are never changed, except from Maundy Thursday until Ascension, as will be seen in their respective places.
Therefore, since the above are always said in the same manner whether a Feast, Sunday, or Feria is being celebrated, it must be understood that when we say, ``Today, the office must be conducted for such a Feast,'' it is as if we were saying that at Matins, the Invitatory, Hymn, Antiphons, \& Third Lesson, \& at Lauds, the Antiphon \& the Prayer (which is also to be said at the remaining hours, except Prime \& Compline), \& at Vespers, the Hymn \& Antiphon are said for the feast itself, \& only in this change does the diversity of the office consist.

Where the Office should be begun each day.
\end{center}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, that whenever the office is conducted for a Sunday, Feria, or simple feast, as well as for the Common of the Blessed Virgin on Saturdays, the office always begins with Matins.
However, when a double feast is celebrated, its office always begins with Vespers on the preceding day, unless Vespers for another greater double are to be said.
For example:
If tomorrow a double feast occurs, \& no other double feast is celebrated today, today's Vespers are to be said for the double feast of tomorrow.
Similarly, if today a lesser double feast is celebrated, \& tomorrow another double occurs, whether lesser or greater, today's Vespers are to be said for the double feast of tomorrow.
After its prayer is completed, the prayer of today's lesser double feast is immediately to be said for its commemoration, preceded by \color{red} Let us pray. \color{black}
Then \color{red} Let us bless the Lord, \&c., May the souls of the faithful departed, \&c. \color{black}
The same procedure is to be followed when one greater double feast immediately follows another greater double.
However, if today a greater double is celebrated \& tomorrow a lesser double occurs, today's Vespers are to be said for the greater double of today.
After its prayer is completed, the Antiphon \& the proper prayer of tomorrow's lesser double are immediately to be said for its commemoration (if it has them), otherwise from the Common.
The above rules should be understood with the exception of certain feasts \& double octaves, in which a different order is prescribed, as will be explained in their respective places.
However, it should be noted that no commemoration is ever to be made of a simple feast or feria at Lauds \& Vespers, except for the Ferias of Lent, as explained on Ash Wednesday.
For Sundays, a commemoration is made only through the prayer at Lauds \& Vespers of the Sunday itself, when a double feast or an octave, from those contained in the Calendar, is celebrated on it, except for those Sundays to which no prayer is assigned.
Likewise, when during an octave another double feast is celebrated, a commemoration of the octave is made only through the prayer, unless something else is specifically prescribed in any of them.

When double feasts shoud be transferred, \& how.
\end{center}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, if a double feast falls on a Sunday of Advent, or on a Sunday in Septuagesima, or on the Sundays following up to \& including Palm Sunday, the office for the Sunday will be observed, \& the double feast will be transferred to the following Monday.
Thus, on Sunday, Vespers will be said for the double feast, \& after its prayer, the Sunday prayer will also be said for its commemoration.
However, if another double feast occurs on the Monday, then the double feast occurring on the Sunday will be transferred to Tuesday, or to Wednesday, if another double feast also falls on Tuesday.
Similarly, if a double feast falls on Ash Wednesday, it will be transferred to the next Thursday.
Any double feast that falls in the Calendar from Thursday in Holy Week until the octave of Easter will be transferred to the first day after the octave, in the same manner as described above.
If more than one double feast falls within the same octave, they will be transferred in order: the first one celebrated first, the second one later.
If a double feast of a saint occurs from Pentecost to Trinity Sunday inclusive, it will be transferred to the first day after Trinity Sunday, but Vespers on that day will be said for the Trinity, \& after its prayer, a commemoration will be made through the Antiphon \& Prayer for the transferred double feast, which will be celebrated on the following day.
Similarly, if a double feast of a saint falls on the Ascension Day or on Corpus Christi, it will be transferred to the next day.
It should be noted that if a simple feast falls on the day designated for the transferred double feast, no office will be said for the simple feast, but only a commemoration through the Prayer at the end of Prime, as explained for the First Sunday of Advent.

How the office should be conducted during octaves.
\end{center}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, when the office is to be conducted for an octave, as ordered in the Calendar or in the Sunday lessons, the Invitatory, Hymns, Antiphons, \& Prayer are to be said as they are for the principal feast, unless something different is assigned for a particular octave.
The third lesson is always assigned as proper for each day throughout the entire octave.
It should be noted that the Antiphon assigned for the second Vespers of the principal feast is always to be said at Vespers throughout the entire octave, unless another is specifically assigned.
Additionally, Antiphons at Matins, Lauds, \& Vespers are not duplicated during octaves but only on the octave day itself, as will be explained.
It should also be noted that if the octave of Corpus Christi coincides with the octave of St. John (which is very rare), the office will be conducted for the octave of Corpus Christi, with a commemoration of St. John through prayer only.
There are also certain other octaves for which no office is conducted because they coincide with other double feasts or octaves; what should be done in such cases will be explained in their respective places.

How many Sundays there are in a year, \& how they are determined.
\end{center}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, that the year, from the First Sunday of Advent to the next similar First Sunday of Advent, exclusive, generally has fifty-two Sundays distributed as follows:
Four Sundays of Advent, between which, \& including Septuagesima, there are necessarily at least three Sundays called the Sundays after Advent.
Three additional Sundays: Septuagesima, Sexagesima, \& Quinquagesima.
Four Sundays of Lent, along with two more for Passion \& Palm Sunday.
Then, Easter, \& five more Sundays after Easter.
Additionally, one more within the octave of Ascension.
Next is Pentecost, between which \& the First Sunday of Advent there cannot be fewer than twenty-three
%pp35
Sundays, which are called the Sundays after Pentecost.
There are also five additional Sundays, which are called Vagrant Sundays because, due to the variability of Septuagesima, they do not always occupy the same position. In some years, all of them fall before Septuagesima, in others after Pentecost, \& in other years (which occurs more frequently), not all five fall together but only some occur before Septuagesima, \& the rest after Pentecost.
Since it rarely happens that the fifth Vagrant Sunday is read before Septuagesima, we have placed it twenty-three Sundays after Pentecost in the Breviary, \& it is called the twenty-fourth.
The other four Vagrant Sundays are placed between the third Sunday after Advent \& Septuagesima, to be distributed each year as they occur. How this should be done can be found in the rule before the First Vagrant Sunday.
Another rule with an index can be found before the Third Sunday after Pentecost. There, you will also find without difficulty how to repeat one of the Vagrant Sundays after Pentecost, namely the one that was last read before Septuagesima, when there are fifty-three Sundays in the year.
However, this can occur no more frequently than every sixth year.

When the Office should be of the Sunday, \& when\\it should be of the feast or octave occurring on it.
\end{center}

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, that on Sundays when there is no occurrence of a double feast or octave, or the Vigil of the Nativity of the Lord, or the Vigil of the Epiphany, the office is always of the Sunday. If a simple feast falls on a Sunday, its office is omitted, \& a commemoration is made of it only by an Prayer at the end of Prime, before the \color{red} Precious \color{black} is said, except on the Sundays of the Resurrection, Pentecost, \& Trinity, where no commemoration of a simple feast should be made.
However, when a double feast occurs on a Sunday, then on the aforementioned three Sundays, \& on the Sundays of Advent, as well as on Septuagesima \& the following Sundays up to the octave of Easter, the feast is transferred as stated above in the third rule.
%pp36
On other Sundays, whenever a double feast falls on a Sunday in the Calendar, the office is of the double feast with a commemoration of the Sunday in Lauds \& Vespers by prayer only, unless it is one of the Sundays to which no Prayer is assigned.
Similarly, when a Sunday falls within an octave, the office is always of the octave with a commemoration of the Sunday, as mentioned above, unless it concerns the Vagrant Sundays which occur after Pentecost, or those falling within the octaves of Christmas \& its movable feasts, as no commemoration of the Sunday should then be made.
The third lesson assigned to the Sunday in the Dominical is always omitted when the office is of a double feast or octave contained in the Calendar, except on the Sunday within the octave of Epiphany, as will be detailed therein.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, that when no feast or octave occurs on a feria, the office is to be of the Feria, \& then the Invitatory, Hymns, Antiphons, \& Prayer are to be said as they were on the Sunday that immediately preceded, unless on that Sunday a double feast or octave was celebrated. In that case, the above-mentioned elements are to be said as they would have been if no double feast or octave had occurred on that Sunday.
However, there are certain Ferias where the office is not as on the preceding Sunday, but something else is assigned, as will be seen in the appropriate places. The third lesson, however, is to be read from the Epistles, as assigned in the Calendar.
However, all the Ferias of Lent are excepted from this rule, in which, unless a double feast occurs, or the transferred celebration from Ash Wednesday or a Sunday is to be observed, the office is always of the Feria, as is more fully explained on Ash Wednesday, \& then a proper third lesson \& Prayer are assigned to each Feria.
Similarly, in Advent, when no feast occurs, a third lesson is assigned to each Feria from the sermons of Saints Ambrose \& Augustine.

Likewise, the offices of simple feasts occurring on all the aforementioned days are to be omitted, except on the Ferias of Advent. However, if anyone wishes to read the lesson of a simple feast even extraordinarily, especially when it is proper, he will do so commendably.

However, at the other hours, the Antiphons are only begun before the psalms, \& afterward, when the psalms have been completed, they are said in full.

Similarly, the Prayer assigned to Lauds on Sundays \& Ferias, as well as on simple feasts \& in the common of the Blessed Virgin, should be said.
It should also be noted that before any Prayer, whether said primarily or by commemoration, the \color{red} Let us pray \color{black} is always preceded, except in the Prayers said during the Litany \& in the Office of the Dead, because then \color{red} Let us pray \color{black} is said only before the first Prayer \& not at the others.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, that in a leap year February has twenty-nine days, \& then the feast of St. Matthias is to be celebrated not on the twenty-fourth, but on the twenty-fifth day.
Therefore, on both the twenty-fourth \& the twenty-sixth, the third lesson assigned in the Calendar for the twenty-fifth day is read. Similarly, on the twenty-seventh, the third lesson assigned for the twenty-sixth day is read.
On the twenty-eighth, the Office of Saints Julian \& Euno is celebrated, \& on the twenty-ninth, the third lesson assigned for the twenty-eighth day is read.
The above regulations are to be understood when the Office of the Week before Lent is celebrated. For if any of the aforementioned days falls on a Sunday or Saturday, or if it is Lent, or if the feast of St. Matthias is to be transferred, then other rules h\&ed down concerning these matters must be observed.
Regarding the Psalms \& the first \& second lessons, it does not matter whether it is a leap year or not. For always Sunday has its own psalms, Monday its own, Tuesday its own, \& so forth: \& similarly, the first \& second lessons are assigned.\\

\color{red} On how \color{black} the Office should be done on Saturdays, see the rule in the Common of the Blessed Virgin near the end of the Breviary.\\
\color{red} On when \color{black} the Office of the Dead should be said, \& when the Seven Psalms should also be said, you will find the rules at their beginnings near the end of the Breviary.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} N}}{ote}, that Advent of the Lord is always celebrated wherever Sunday falls between the fifth of December \& the third of that month, \& it will always be the Sunday closest to the feast of St. Andrew. Often, the said feast occurs on the very same Sunday.

However, nothing is added to or diminished from the divine office because of this; they are mentioned here only to indicate when they are celebrated, with respect to fasting \& what is to be said in the Mass celebration during these times.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\textbf{\color{red} T}}{herefore} before beginning the divine office each day, one should note whether it is Sunday, a Feria, or Saturday, \& which Sunday or feria it is.
Next, one should check what is commemorated on that day in the Calendar or in the Sunday: 
By following the above rules, it will be very easy for one to know what office to perform, as well as which Psalms \& lessons should be recited.

Hear, O ye heavens, \& give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, \& exalted them: but they have despised me. The ox knoweth his owner, \& the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, \& my people hath not understood. Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards. For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, \& the whole heart is sad.
From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds \& bruises \& swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.

Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.
To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, \& fat of fatlings, \& blood of calves, \& lambs, \& buck goats.

And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments \& justifications of the Lord without blame. And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren, \& they both were well advanced in years.

And\rightmarginnote{B} Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, \& my wife is advanced in years.

And behold, thou shalt be dumb, \& shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.
And the people were waiting for Zachary; \& they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple. And when he came out, he could not speak to them: \& they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them, \& remained dumb. And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.

\newline \color{red} T\color{black}he lesson of the Holy Gospel, which your fraternity has just heard, was preceded by the Lord saying a little earlier:
Nation shall rise against nation, \& kingdom against kingdom. And there shall be great earthquakes in divers places, \& pestilences, \& famines.
And after inserting certain intervening words, He added what you have just now heard:
There shall be signs in the sun, \& in the moon, \& in the stars; \& upon the earth distress of nations, by reason of the confusion of the roaring of the sea \& of the waves.
Of these things, indeed, we see that some have already occurred, while others we fear are about to come soon.
For we observe more in our tribulations that nations are rising against nations, \& their distress weighing upon the earth, than we read about in the books.
As for earthquakes toppling countless cities, you have frequently heard how often this has been reported from other parts of the world.
We are enduring pestilence without cessation.
%pp187
However, we have not yet openly seen signs in the sun, moon, \& stars.
But since these are also not far off, we deduce their approach from the very changes already occurring in the atmosphere.
For instance, before Italy was handed over to be struck by the sword of the pagans, we saw fiery formations in the sky, which later foreshadowed the spilling of human blood, shining as lightning.
As for the confusion of the sea \& its waves, that has not yet arisen as something new.
But since many things foretold have already been fulfilled, there is no doubt that the few remaining things will also follow.
For the certainty of future events is established by the fulfillment of those that have already occurred.
These things, dearest brothers, we say to you so that your minds may be awakened to the pursuit of vigilance:
that they may not grow sluggish through complacency, nor weakened by ignorance, but that they may always be stirred by fear \& strengthened in good works through careful attention.
Let us reflect on what our Redeemer added in His words:
Men will faint with fear \& with expectation of what is coming upon the whole world.
For the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

And the angel being come in, said unto her: Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. Who having heard,
%pp196
was troubled at his saying, \& thought with herself what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said to her: Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.
Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, \& shalt bring forth a son; \& thou shalt call his name Jesus. He shall be great, \& shall be called the Son of the most High; \& the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father; \& he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end. And Mary said to the angel: How shall this be done, because I know not man? And the angel answering, said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, \& the power of the most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
And behold thy cousin Elizabeth, she also hath conceived a son in her old age; \& this is the sixth month with her that is called barren: Because no word shall be impossible with God. 38 And Mary said: Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it done to me according to thy word.]

And Mary rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda. And she entered into the house of Zachary, \& saluted Elizabeth.
And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the infant leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost: And she cried out with a loud voice, \& said: Blessed art thou among women, \& blessed is the fruit of thy womb. And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the infant in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed art thou that hast believed, because those things shall be accomplished that were spoken to thee by the Lord.
And Mary said: My soul doth magnify the Lord. And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.]
Because\leftmarginnote{\begin{flushright}E\end{flushright}} he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid; for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed. Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me; \& holy is his name. And his mercy is from generation unto generations, to them that fear him.
He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath scattered the proud in the conceit of their heart. He hath put down the mighty from their seat, \& hath exalted the humble. He hath filled the hungry with good things; \& the rich he hath sent empty away. He hath received Israel his servant, being mindful of his mercy: As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham \& to his seed for ever.

For although Christ our Lord, after His Passion, rose again \& ascended into heaven, He nonetheless considers, as we believe, \& attentively observes how each of His servants prepares \& arranges themselves for celebrating His Nativity, striving to do so without greed, anger, pride, or lust. And according to how He sees each adorned with good morals, so He will dispense to them the grace of His mercy.
For if He sees one clothed in the light of charity, adorned with the pearls of justice or mercy, chaste, humble, merciful, kind, \& sober, He will give that person His Body \& Blood not for judgment, but for remedy, through the ministry of His priests.
But if He sees someone adulterous, drunken, covetous, \& proud, I fear that what the Lord Himself said in the Gospel will be applied to them: ``Friend, how did you come here without a wedding garment?'' And, may the Lord avert it, what follows will happen: ``Bind his hands \& feet, \& cast him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping \& gnashing of teeth.''
Behold the sentence that one will receive on the Day of Judgment, who approaches the Lord's feast stained with the filth of vices, without the remedy of penance.
For on the Lord's Nativity, beloved brothers, as in a spiritual wedding, Christ is joined with His Bride, the Church. Then Truth arose from the earth, then Justice looked down from heaven, then the Bridegroom proceeded from His chamber, that is, the Word of God proceeded from the virginal womb.
He proceeded with His Bride, the Church; that is, He took on human flesh. Therefore, when invited to these most holy nuptials \& to the feast of the Father, the Son, \& the Holy Spirit, see with what garments we ought to adorn ourselves.
%pp198
And therefore, let us cleanse as much as we can, with the help of God, both our hearts \& our bodies, so that that heavenly Guest may find nothing in us filthy, foul, or obscene, nothing unworthy in His sight.

And man hath bowed himself down, \& man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not. Enter thou into the rock, \& hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, \& from the glory of his majesty.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\bfseries \color{red} H}{ear}, brothers, not my command you hear, but the common command of the Lord.
For thus He said in the Gospel: When you make a dinner or a supper, do not invite the rich, so that they may invite you in return \& you be repaid; but invite the poor \& the crippled, \& you will be blessed, because they have nothing with which to repay you; but you will be repaid at the resurrection of the just.
But someone may say, Then should I not invite friends or relatives to a meal?
Relatives \& neighbors are to be invited, but more sparingly.
And the meals prepared for them should be no less sumptuous \& delightful, yet so frugal, sober, \& decent that there remains something with which the poor may be fed, something may be given to those in need; so that when the day of judgment comes, we may not hear, with the wicked who now despise the poor: Depart from me, accursed, into everlasting fire, but with the just \& merciful we may merit to hear: Come, blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom; for I was hungry \& you gave me to eat, thirsty \& you gave me to drink. At the same time may that desirable voice also be directed to us: Well done, good \& faithful servant; because you have been faithful over little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your Lord.
But so that these things, which we have suggested, may cling more firmly to the senses of your charity, we briefly repeat what has been said.
For we admonish you, brothers, that since the Nativity of the Lord is near, we prepare ourselves as for a nuptial \& heavenly feast, adorned with good works \& free from all luxury, giving alms to the poor, \& casting out from our hearts wrath, hatred, \& venom.
Faithfully preserve chastity, more often recall the poor to your meals, rise earlier for vigils, standing in church either pray or sing psalms; do not utter idle or obscene words, \& correct those who wish to do so.
Keep peace with all, \& recall those whom you find discordant to concord.
If you faithfully wish to carry out these things with Christ assisting you, you will be able in this life to approach the Lord's altar with a clear conscience, \& in the future to reach eternal blessedness happily, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who lives \& reigns forever \& ever. Amen.

And therefore I exhort \& admonish you, that as much as we can, with the help of God, we labor so that on that day we may be able to approach the Lord's altar with sincere \& pure conscience, a clean heart, \& a chaste body, \& may merit to receive His Body \& Blood not for judgment, but for the remedy of our soul.
For our life consists in the Body of Christ, as He Himself said: ``Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man \& drink His blood, you will have no life in you.''
Let him therefore change his life who wishes to receive life.
For if he does not change his life, he will receive life unto judgment, \& will be more corrupted than healed; more killed than vivified.
For thus the Apostle said: ``Whoever eats the Body of the Lord \& drinks His Blood unworthily, eats \& drinks judgment to himself.''
%pp203
And although we ought always to be adorned \& splendid in good works, especially on the day of the Lord's Nativity, as He Himself said in the Gospel, ``Let your works shine before men,'' consider, I pray, brothers, how when a powerful or noble man desires to celebrate his own birthday or that of his son, with what diligence, many days beforehand, he arranges that everything in his house that is filthy is cleaned, that whatever is inept or inappropriate is thrown out, \& that whatever is useful \& necessary is provided.
Even if the house is dark, it is whitewashed; the floors are swept; it is adorned with various flowers. Everything pertaining to the delight of soul \& body is provided for with care.
What is all this, beloved brothers, except that the birthday may be celebrated with joy for the one who is dying?
If then so much is prepared for your own or your son's birthday, how much \& what kind of preparation ought you make for the Nativity of your Lord?
If such things you prepare for a mortal, what ought you to prepare for the eternal?
Therefore, whatever you would not wish to find in your house, labor as much as you can that God may not find in your soul.

\lettrine[lines=2]{\bfseries \color{red} C}{ertainly}, if an earthly king, or any master of a household, were to invite you to his birthday feast, with what kind of clothing would you strive to appear? How new, how clean, how splendid, so that neither oldness, nor cheapness, nor any stain would offend the eyes of the one who invited you?
With such care, then, as far as you are able (with Christ's help), strive that your soul be arranged with the varied ornaments of virtues, adorned with the jewels of simplicity \& the flowers of sobriety, so that it may proceed with a secure conscience to the solemnity of the eternal King, that is, to the Nativity of the Lord \& Savior, shining with chastity, resplendent with charity, bright with almsgiving.
For if Christ the Lord finds you thus prepared to celebrate His birthday, He Himself will deign not only to visit your soul, but even to rest in it, \& to dwell there forever, as it is written: ``And I will dwell in them, \& walk among them.'' And again: ``Behold, I stand at the door \& knock: if anyone rises \& opens to me, I will enter to him \& will dine with him, \& he with me.''
How happy is that soul which, with God's help, strives so to order its life that it merits to receive Christ as its guest \& indweller! And on the contrary, how wretched is that conscience, lamentable with a whole flood of tears, which has stained itself with evil deeds so that Christ no longer rests there, but the devil begins to reign?
Such a soul, unless the medicine of repentance quickly comes to its aid, is abandoned by light, seized by darkness, emptied of sweetness, filled with bitterness, overtaken by death, \& cast away from life.
Yet let not such a one despair of the Lord's mercy, nor be crushed by deadly hopelessness. Rather, let him flee quickly to repentance, \& while the wounds of his sins are still new \& fresh, let him apply wholesome remedies. For our Physician is almighty, \& He so heals our wounds that no trace of the scars remains after His medicine.
Therefore, you must abstain for many days before His Nativity from every defilement.
\newline And whenever you prepare to celebrate the Nativity of the Lord, or any other solemnity,
%pp206
above all flee drunkenness; resist anger as though it were a most cruel beast; drive hatred from your heart as though it were deadly poison; \& let such charity be found in you that it reaches not only to friends, but even to enemies themselves, so that you may safely say in the Lord's Prayer: ``Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.''

\lettrine[lines=2]{\bfseries \color{red} I}{}\ believe I have said enough, even more than enough, in the previous discourse about how properly \& worthily we ought to receive the Nativity of the Lord, \& how we ought to preserve the coming feast from all ambition.
To preserve it, I say, so that even if the day of His Nativity passes, yet the blessedness of His sanctification may remain with us. For this is the grace of the Lord \& Savior's Nativity: that it passes forward to the predestined, \& remains in the past with the devout.
Therefore, we ought to be pure in holiness, clean in chastity, radiant in honesty, so that as we see the feast day drawing nearer, we may walk with greater care.
For if women, when preparing to observe some festival, are accustomed to wash the stains of their garments with water, why should we not, as we prepare to receive the Nativity of the Lord, wash away the stains of our souls with tears?
And if, indeed, those garments should be so deeply stained with filth that mere water cannot cleanse the spots,

they add the softness of oil \& even the sharpness of soap. So also we, if the sin is so grave that it cannot be cleansed with tears alone, must add the oil of mercy \& the sharpness of fasting.
For there is no sin so grave that it cannot be purified by abstinence \& extinguished by almsgiving. For the holy prophet says: ``As water quenches fire, so almsgiving quenches sin.''
Great indeed is almsgiving, which cools the burning coals of guilt with the stream of its goodwill, \& by a kind of irrigation of generosity smothers the fires of transgression, so that, even though God is offended \& provoked by our sins, He is compelled by our almsgiving to deliver those whom He had decreed to punish for their sins. He is, in a sense, constrained by us, when He is compelled by our deeds to change His judgment, so that in one \& the same man He now shows the gentleness of a Father's mercy \& now the severity of a Judge. For God is our Father when we act well; He is our Judge when we sin.

\newline \color{red} W\color{black}e must carefully consider, dearest brothers, John the prophet, \& more than a prophet, who pointed out the Lord coming to the baptism of the Jordan, saying: ``Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world.'' And when he reflected both on his own humility \& on the power of Christ's divinity, he said: ``He who is of the earth speaks of the earth; but he who comes from heaven is above all.''
Why then, when placed in prison, does he send his disciples to ask: ``Are you the one who is to come, or do we look for another?'', as though he did not know whom he had already pointed out, \& as though he were uncertain whether it was truly he, whom by prophesying, baptizing, \& proclaiming he had already declared to be the Christ?
This question is easily solved if we consider the time \& order of the events. While he stood by the waters of the Jordan, he affirmed that Christ was the Redeemer of the world. But once he had been cast into prison, he asked whether they should expect another, or whether he himself had truly come.
%pp226
Not because he doubted that this was the Redeemer of the world, but because he wished to know whether the same Lord who had come into the world in person, would also in person descend to the prison of hell.
For the one whom he had announced beforehand to the world, he was also to precede by dying \& descending into the underworld. Thus he asks: ``Are you the one who is to come, or do we look for another?'' As if to say openly: Just as you deigned to be born for humankind, will you also deign to die for humankind, so that I, who was your forerunner in birth, may also be your forerunner in death, \& may proclaim to hell your coming, just as I have already proclaimed your coming to the world?
And so, when questioned, the Lord responded not with words of high majesty but immediately with the humility of his coming death, though listing the miracles of his power: ``The blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again, the poor are preached to. And blessed is he who is not scandalized in me.''
At such signs \& so great miracles, no one could rightly take offense, rather, they ought to marvel. Yet the hearts of unbelievers took deep offense when they saw him die after so many wonders. And so Paul says: ``We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews indeed a stumbling block, \& to the Gentiles foolishness.'' For it seemed folly to men that the Author of life should die for men, \& from this, mankind took offense against him, when all the more it should have made them his debtors. \quad \color{red} Prayer. \color{black}

Then Jesus said to them: I ask you, if it be lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to destroy? And looking round about on them all, he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: \& his hand was restored.

\newline \color{red} F\color{black}rom the words of this reading, dearest brothers, the humility of John is commended to us.
For although he was of such great virtue that he might have been believed to be the Christ, he chose to stand firmly in himself, lest he be vainly swept up by human opinion beyond what he was.
For he confessed \& did not deny; he confessed: ``I am not the Christ.''
By saying ``I am not,'' he clearly denied what he was not; yet he did not deny what he was, so that by speaking the truth he might become a member of Him whose name he would not falsely usurp.
Therefore, because he did not wish to seize the name of Christ, he was made a member of Christ.
For while he sought humbly to acknowledge his own weakness, he merited in truth to obtain that One's greatness.
But while from another reading a saying of our Redeemer is brought back to mind, from the words of this reading a very intricate question arises.
For in another place, when asked by his disciples about the coming of Elijah, the Lord replied: Elijah has already come, \& they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they wished. And if you are willing to accept it, he is John himself.
But when John is asked, he says: I am not Elijah.
What is this, dearest brothers? That what Truth affirms, the prophet of Truth denies?
For indeed, ``he is'' \& ``I am not'' are very different from each other.
How then can he be the prophet of Truth, if he is not in agreement with the words of the same Truth?
But if Truth itself is carefully examined, it is found that what seemed opposed is not in fact opposed.
For to Zechariah, concerning the promise of John, the angel said: He shall go before him in the spirit \& power of Elijah.
He is therefore said to come in the spirit \& power of Elijah, because just as
%pp240
Elijah will precede the second coming of the Lord, so John preceded the first.
As Elijah will be the forerunner of the Judge, so John was made the forerunner of the Redeemer.
Therefore John was Elijah in spirit, but he was not Elijah in person.
What the Lord affirms of the spirit, John denies of the person.
For it was fitting that the Lord should speak to his disciples of John in a spiritual sense, \& that John should reply to the crowds, who were fleshly-minded, not concerning his spirit but concerning his body.
Thus what John said seems contrary to the Truth; yet he did not depart from the path of Truth.

\newline \color{red} ``E\color{black}very valley shall be filled, \& every mountain \& hill shall be made low.'' What is meant here by ``valleys,'' if not the humble?
And what are the mountains \& hills, if not proud men?
At the coming of our Redeemer, therefore, the valleys were filled, \& the mountains \& hills were humbled. For according to His own words: ``Everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, \& he who humbles himself shall be exalted.''
For a filled valley grows, whereas a humbled mountain or hill diminishes.
For indeed, through faith in the Mediator between God \& men, Jesus Christ, the man, Gentiles received the fullness of grace, \& the Jews, through the error of their perfidy, lost what they had hitherto arrogantly claimed.
Hence, ``every valley shall be filled'': because the hearts of the humble are filled by the eloquence of holy doctrine, through the grace of virtue, according to what is written: ``He causes the fountains to flow in the valleys.'' And again it is said: ``And the valleys shall abound with grain.''
For water runs down from the mountains: because lofty minds are abandoned by the doctrine of truth. But fountains rise in the valleys: because the minds of the humble hear \& receive the word of the preacher.
Now we see, now we behold the valleys abounding with grain: because their mouths are filled with the food of truth, although the meek \& simple seemed to this world to be contemptible.

Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, \& not one of them is forgotten before God? Yea, the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not therefore: you are of more value than many sparrows. And I say to you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God.

And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but to him that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven.
And when they shall bring you into the synagogues, \& to magistrates \& powers, be not solicitous how or what you shall answer, or what you shall say; For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what you must say. And one of the multitude said to him: Master, speak to my brother that he divide the inheritance with me. But he said to him: Man, who hath appointed me judge, or divider, over you? And he said to them: Take heed \& beware of all covetousness; for a man's life doth not consist in the abundance of things which he possesseth.
And he spoke a similitude to them, saying: The land of a certain rich man brought forth plenty of fruits. And he thought within himself, saying: What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns, \& will build greater; \& into them will I gather all things that are grown to me, \& my goods. And I will say to my soul: Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thy rest; eat, drink, make good cheer. But God said to him: Thou fool, this night do they require thy soul of thee: \& whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?
So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, \& is not rich towards God.

The life is more than the meat, \& the body is more than the raiment. Consider the ravens, for they sow not, neither do they reap, neither have they storehouse nor barn, \& God feedeth them. How much are you more valuable than they? And which of you, by taking thought, can add to his stature one cubit?
If then ye be not able to do so much as the least thing, why are you solicitous for the rest? Consider the lilies, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin. But I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these. Now if God clothe in this manner the grass that is today in the field, \& tomorrow is cast into the oven; how much more you, O ye of little faith? And seek not you what you shall eat, or what you shall drink: \& be not lifted up on high. For all these things do the nations of the world seek. But your Father knoweth that you have need of these things.
But seek ye first the kingdom of God \& his justice, \& all these things shall be added unto you. Fear not, little flock, for it hath pleased your Father
%pp268
to give you a kingdom. Sell what you possess \& give alms. Make to yourselves bags which grow not old, a treasure in heaven which faileth not: where no thief approacheth, nor moth corrupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. Let your loins be girt, \& lamps burning in your hands.
And you yourselves like to men who wait for their lord, when he shall return from the wedding; that when he cometh \& knocketh, they may open to him immediately. Blessed are those servants, whom the Lord when he cometh, shall find watching. Amen I say to you, that he will gird himself, \& make them sit down to meat, \& passing will minister unto them. And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third watch, \& find them so, blessed are those servants. But this know ye, that if the householder did know at what hour the thief would come, he would surely watch, \& would not suffer his house to be broken open. Be you then also ready: for at what hour you think not, the Son of man will come.

And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold, \& shall give up all the substance of his house. But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul: He gathereth to himself shame \& dishonour, \& his reproach shall not be blotted out: Because the jealousy \& rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge, Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts.

Who said: An hundred quarters of wheat. He said to him: Take thy bill, \& write eighty.

And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant. And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by. And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me. And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me. And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,
Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see. And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he saw, \& followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.]

\newline \color{red} ``T\color{black}he child Jesus increased in wisdom \& in stature, \& in favor with God.'' This is something human nature does not receive, that wisdom should be completed before twelve years of age.
For it is one thing to possess the power of wisdom, \& another for wisdom to be complete. Therefore, let us not doubt that something divine appeared in the flesh of Jesus; \& not only did He grow over man, but also over every rational creature.
For He had humbled Himself, taking the form of a servant; \& by the same power by which He humbled Himself, He grew.
He appeared weak because He assumed a weak body, \& therefore He was strengthened again \& again.
And He emptied Himself as the Son of God; \& for this reason He was again filled with wisdom; \& the grace of God was upon Him, not only when He reached adolescence, not only when He taught openly, but even when He was still a little child, He had the grace of God.
And just as all things in Him were marvelous, so in His childhood He was marvelous, that the wisdom of God might be fulfilled.
Therefore His parents went according to custom to Jerusalem for the solemn day of the Passover. And when Jesus was twelve years old,
observe carefully: before He was twelve years old, the wisdom of God \& the other things written about Him were already being fulfilled.
Therefore, when, as we said, He was twelve years old, \& the days of the solemn feast were completed according to custom, \& His parents returned home with the child Jesus, the boy remained in Jerusalem, \& His parents did not know it. \color{red} Oratio. \color{black}

But the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection, \& the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out.

For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, \& thou reapest that which thou didst not sow. He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, \& reaping that which I did not sow: And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?

O how beautiful is the chaste generation with glory: for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is known both with God \& with men. 2 When it is present, they imitate it: \& they desire it when it hath withdrawn itself, \& it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts. 3 But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive, \& bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation. 4 And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, \& through the force of winds they shall be rooted out. 5 For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, \& their fruits shall be unprofitable, \& sour to eat, \& fit for nothing.

 6 For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial. 7 But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest. 8 For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs. 9 And a spotless life is old age. 10 He pleased God \& was beloved, \& living among sinners he was translated.

 11 He was taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul. 12 For the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things, \& the wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent mind. 13 Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time: 14 For his soul pleased God: therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities: but the people see this, \& understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts: 15 That the grace of God, \& his mercy is with his saints, \& that he hath respect to his chosen.

 16 But the just that is dead, condemneth the wicked that are living, \& youth soon ended, the long life of the unjust. 17 For they shall see the end of the wise man, \& shall not understand what God hath designed for him, \& why the Lord hath set him in safety. 18 They shall see him, \& shall despise him: but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn. 19 And they shall fall after this without honour, \& be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst them puffed up \& speechless, \& shall shake them from the foundations, \& they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in sorrow, \& their memory shall perish. 20 They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins, \& their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them.

In omnibus exhibuistis vos, incontaminatos esse negotio. Igitur etsi scripsi vobis, non propter eum qui fecit iniuriam, nec propter eum qui passus est: sed ad manifestandam solicitudinem nostram quam habemus pro vobis coram Deo, ideo consolati sumus. In consolatione autem nostra, abundantius magis gauisi sumus super gaudio Titi, quia refectus est spiritus eius ab omnibus vobis. Et si quid apud illum de vobis gloriatus sum, non sum confusus: sed sicut omnia vobis in veritate locuti sumus, ita \& gloriatio nostra qu\ae \ fuit ad Titum, veritas facta est: \& viscera eius abundantius in vobis sunt, reminiscentis omnium vestrum obedientiam, quomodo cum timore \& tremore excepistis illum.

Sed quanquam angeli quo superiores sunt, hoc rarius a Deo in ministerium aliquod mittantur (tutelares enim quorum cuiusque fidei singuli homines committuntur ex infimo ordine sunt) tamen ex omni ordine quandoque mitti testatur Paulus, qui omnes (inquit) sunt administratorij spritus in ministerium missi.

Et quidem sufficere poterat Christus, siquidem \& nunc omnis sufficientia nostra ex Deo est: sed nobis bonum non erat esse hominem solum. Congruum magis, vt adesset nostr\ae \ reparationi sexus vterque, quorum corruptioni neuter defuisset. Fidelis plane \& potens mediator Dei \& hominum, homo Christus Iesus, sed diuinam in eo reuerentur homines maiestatem.
Opus est enim mediatore ad mediatorem istum: nec alter nobis vtilior quam Maria. Crudelis nimium Eua, per quam serpens antiquus pestiferum etiam ipsi viro virus infudit: sed fidelis Maria, qu\ae \ salutis antidotum \& viris \& mulieribus propinauit.
