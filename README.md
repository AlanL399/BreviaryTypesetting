### Project Overview
The Breviary Typesetting Project is dedicated to typesetting and translating historical breviaries with LaTeX.

### Projects
This repository contains work on the following breviaries:

- **1563 Breviary of the Holy Cross** (*Quignones*): There are Latin and English versions.
- **1256 Dominican Breviary** (*Humbert*): The Breviary excerpts from Humbert's Ordinal. There are two versions, a regular and a pocket-sized PDF.
- **1775 Mozarabic Breviary** (*Gothicum*)
