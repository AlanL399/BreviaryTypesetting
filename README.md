 Retypesetting old Breviaries
 
 Currently retypesetting a [1563 Quinonez Breviary](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JxRaJVPlH5EC/mode/2up) and concurrently translating it into English.
 
 I have decided to expand the abbreviations marked by the tildes, but I am keeping the original u/v usage. The long s is not used. hooked E's are expanded to ae.

 Work on [1256 Dominican Breviary](https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_JxRaJVPlH5EC/mode/2up) has begun.
