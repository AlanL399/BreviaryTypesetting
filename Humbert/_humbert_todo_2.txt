Humbert Todo
1. Augmnet to existing todo
2. \newline vs \linebreak
3. The default values for hyphenpenalty, tolerance, and emergencystretch in LaTeX are:

    hyphenpenalty: 50 - lower it
    tolerance: 200 - increase it
    emergencystretch: 0pt - increase it

	It's important to note that these values can be influenced by the document class and packages used. For example, different classes might set different tolerances. Also, emergencystretch being 0pt by default means that if LaTeX really can't find a good way to break a line within the given tolerances, it will produce overfull boxes (lines sticking out into the margin) rather than stretching the inter-word spacing beyond its normal limits. Setting emergencystretch to a small positive value (e.g., \emergencystretch=3em) can often improve the appearance of a document with difficult line breaks, at the cost of slightly uneven spacing.
	
4. \usepackage[tracking]{microtype}
	\SetTracking{encoding=*}{50}  % applies 50% letter-spacing to entire document

6. Font choices, related to 4.
That's a solid set of free fonts to evaluate. Let me quickly characterize them:

ET Book:
- Designed for scholarly text
- Very precise, clean design
- Optimized for readability
- Slightly narrow letterforms

Libre Baskerville:
- Web-optimized version of classic Baskerville
- Wider spacing than traditional Baskerville
- Might not meet your tight spacing requirement

Cardo:
- Scholarly/biblical text focus
- Unicode-rich
- Good for academic/religious texts

Libre Caslon Text:
- Derived from classic Caslon
- More open spacing
- Might be too wide for your needs

EB Garamond:
- Closest to traditional book typography
- Open-source recreation of classic Garamond
- Potentially good for tight spacing

Linux Libertine offers good compact design

Based on your previous comments about tight letter spacing, EB Garamond or ET Book might be your best candidates. Would you like to discuss their specific characteristics further?
