# Font Summary for LuaLaTeX Latin Breviary
**Goal: Compactness at small sizes + readability**

---

## **LIBRE/FREE FONTS**

### **Top Tier for Readability at Small Sizes:**

**Charis SIL** ⭐
- **Best practical choice** - specifically designed for small-size readability
- Higher x-height, sturdy letterforms, excellent contrast
- Extensive glyphs for multilingual texts
- Less traditional/ecclesiastical appearance

**Gentium Plus** (SIL)
- Similar readability to Charis but more elegant
- Calligraphic touch while maintaining clarity
- Good for older eyes at small sizes

**Junicode**
- Purpose-built for medieval Latin
- More robust than Garamond at small sizes
- Extensive specialized characters

### **Moderate - Trade-offs Required:**

**ET Book** - Narrow letterforms aid compactness, but may be too fine for distance/older eyes

**Cardo** - Scholarly focus, but not optimized for tiny sizes

**Source Serif Pro** - Clear but **too wide** for compact layouts

**Merriweather** - Good x-height aids readability BUT **too wide** for two-column breviary

**Utopia** - Balanced, but not specifically optimized for small sizes

### **Poor Choice for Stated Use Case:**

**EB Garamond**
- Low contrast, small x-height, delicate serifs
- **Difficult to read at small sizes or for older eyes**
- Beautiful but functionally wrong for this application

**Libre Baskerville / Baskervald** - Too wide + readability issues

**Libre Caslon Text** - Too wide

**Cormorant Garamond** - Display font, not for body text
